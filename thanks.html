			Thank you for for your interest in Election Watch!
			</p>
			<p>
			At this time we are reviewing volunteer sign-up data along with other information to determine where we will launch the pilot program for Election Watch. During the pilot program we plan to run the program in 2 - 3 states, after which we will begin rolling out the program nationwide.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the meantime, please consider making a donation to the Lawyers for Good Government Foundation to support the Election Watch program. We are a new organization with limited funding and need your support to launch this ambitious effort to protect voting rights in counties all over the country.
