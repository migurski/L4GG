			Thank you for signing up to protect our most cherished civil right. Your information will be reviewed by a volunteer coordinator for your state. Other volunteers are putting together training materials and a national incident reporting system. It may take some time to circle back to your application so please be patient, we have no paid staffers dedicated to the project, just volunteers.

			Lawyers for Good Government is a new organization coordinating volunteer lawyers across the country to work with longstanding civil rights organizations to scale to this eraâ€™s new challenges. We have more projects in the works, but could use funding to help accelerate those projects. Please consider becoming a sustaining member so we can continue to grow our volunteer network.
